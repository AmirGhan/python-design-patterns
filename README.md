# Python Design Patterns

The purpose of this project is to document my deep dive into the world of design patterns. All design patterns are divided into three categories (directories): **Creational**, **Structural** & **Behavioural**. Each pattern is contained within its own module (with its own `.py` script). Each module will contain a sample implementation along with some demonstrative tests and extensive documentation. Each module can be run as a standalone python script or imported into other scripts.

Please feel free to suggest modifications/updates. This project is a work in progress and all implementations are open to debate.
