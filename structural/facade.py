""" The Facade Pattern

Notes:

In my opinion, this is one of the most intuitive design patterns that I have
come across. The point of the Facade pattern is to create a high-level unified
interface that hides more complex objects behind it. It is particularly useful
in situations where:

> There is need for a system which relies on several sub-systems or sub-objects.
> The user of this system needs to a see a simple interface.
> The system can be represented as an object.
